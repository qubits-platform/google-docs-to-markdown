### <span style='font-size:1.73em;color:rgb(215, 115, 115)'>TECHNOLOGY AND INEQUALITY</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Our world has become increasingly technology-driven. In this digital age, computing technology has become an integral part of our daily life. Many impossible things in the past have now been made possible through technology. It helps us communicate with ease, automate tedious tasks, and easily access information and new forms of entertainment. However, one crucial question remains: is technology accessible and equitable across all the different segments of society?</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>In this sprint, we will explore the impacts of computing, the role of technology in our lives, and the issue of digital inequality.</span>

### <span style='font-size:1.73em;color:rgb(215, 115, 115)'>Impacts of computing</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Computing systems have varying effects on individuals, with potentially positive or negative outcomes. As technology continues to evolve and expand, it holds the capacity to enhance, damage, or sustain certain practices. Despite its numerous benefits, it is essential to examine the personal, ethical, social, economic, and cultural implications of technology.</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Let's consider the story of Maria. Maria is an entrepreneur and a chef. She runs a small restaurant that serves organic food. She uses various computing systems to manage her business, including a</span> <span style='font-size:1.09em;color:rgb(55, 112, 152)'>Point of Sale (POS)</span> <span style='font-size:1.09em'>system, an online ordering platform, and various social media platforms. However, she also faces challenges that highlight the positive and negative impact of computing systems.</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Maria uses social media platforms to promote her restaurant and interact with customers. However, she remains concerned about the negative impact of excessive screen time on her mental health.</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Maria's restaurant uses a</span> <span style='font-size:1.09em;color:rgb(55, 112, 152)'>POS</span> <span style='font-size:1.09em'>system to manage orders and payments, which has resulted in increased efficiency and reduced errors. However, she is always concerned about the environmental impact of the packaging materials used for takeout orders.</span> 


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>The restaurant uses an online ordering platform that allows customers to place orders for pickup or delivery. This has increased customer convenience and allowed Maria to expand her customer base. However, she is concerned about the high charges levied by the online food delivery service, which can be difficult for small restaurants like hers to afford.</span> 


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Maria wants to celebrate the cultural heritage of her community through her restaurant, but she's concerned about cultural misappropriation and misrepresentation in the food industry.</span> 


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Therefore, as you can see, there are various personal, ethical, social, economic, and cultural impacts of technology on Maria’s life and business. Scrutinizing each of these aspects can help you gain a deeper understanding of the associated issues. Taking steps to address and resolve concerns like the ones Maria has, is crucial in ensuring that everyone reaps the advantages of digital systems.</span>

<hr/>

### <span style='font-size:1.73em;color:rgb(215, 115, 115)'>Equity bias</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Technology advancements have greatly improved our lives. However, not everyone has equal access to these technologies and digital tools. This disparity arises from several reasons, including limited resources, lack of access to the internet, low levels of education, remote locations, and biased algorithms. Education, business, healthcare, and even economic growth are all impacted by this inequality. Promoting human rights, social justice, and sustainable development requires resolving such issues.</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Even an algorithm-based computing system can produce a bias towards a particular group of people based on the data it receives. For example, automated hiring systems can neglect groups of people with career gaps or disabilities without analyzing the reasons behind them.</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>Many computing systems are not accessible to persons with disabilities. Even a few assistive technologies are expensive to get. Digital training resources for disabled people are limited.</span>

### <span style='font-size:1.73em;color:rgb(215, 115, 115)'>Impacts of inequality</span>


<span style='font-size:1.09em'>The unequal distribution of technology has far-reaching consequences that negatively impact economic outcomes, healthcare, education, and vulnerable groups in society.
